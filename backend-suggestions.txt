[ ] The avatar changes appearance based on the user's answer â€” it looks happy if the answer is correct, sad if incorrect, and shows a neutral smile by default.

[ ] The streak counter should reset to zero when the user gets a wrong answer; otherwise, it should continue counting the user's correct answers.

[ ] At the end of the quiz, the user should be able to play again with a new set of questions (either entirely different or reshuffled/rephrased for mastery).

[ ] The correct answer should be revealed after each question is answered.
